# Nautilus Explorer Dashboard
Welcome to Nautilus, the world's most advanced, electrical-powered submersible. You will be coming aboard to build tools for the Captain to use en route and at destinations across the globe.
While on board, you can see, create, edit and delete data that is needed for our adventure: Crew Members, Destinations, Environmental readings, Log entries, Species and Excursions.

## Description
### Revised instructions from Dr. T
### Week 1:
Welcome to Nautilus, the world's most advanced, electrical-powered submersible. You will be coming aboard to build tools for the Captain to use en route and at destinations across the globe.

Your task is to build a management dashboard for the Captain to keep track of the Crew Members, Destinations, Environmental readings, Log entries, and Species. The Captain should be able to perform full CRUD on each of those 4 topics.  Additionally he should be able to authenticate into the application - if he is not authenticated the dashboard should perform READ only operations.

Captain Nemo expects to see themes throughout the application that radiate the classic opulence and grandeur of Nautilus.
*Mobilis in mobili*.

### Week 2:
The captain was very impressed with the first team, but they have reached their destination and will be disembarking. Now that Nautilus operators able to perform full CRUD on Crew Members, Destinations, Environmental Data, Log entries, and Species they would like to be able to bring all these modules together and create Excursions that include Crew Members, Destinations, Environmental Data, Log Entries, and Species associated with them. Captain Nemo would also like the be able do some reporting and graphing to easily visualize locations and their corresponding data sets as well as restrict some data from being accessed. Good luck! *Mobilis in mobili*.
