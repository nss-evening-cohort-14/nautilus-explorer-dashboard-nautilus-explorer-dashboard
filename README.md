# Nautilus Explorer Dashboard

### Product Owner
Your PO is assigned as an approver and feedback for your application. They are not there to guide you through code. If you have code related needs, submit a completed issue ticket.

PO: **Aja**

## Description
Welcome to Nautilus, the world's most advanced, electrical-powered submersible. You will be coming aboard to build tools for the Captain to use en route and at destinations across the globe.

Your task is to build a management dashboard for the Captain to keep track of the Crew Members, Destinations, Environmental readings, Log entries, and Species. The Captain should be able to perform full CRUD on each of those 4 topics.  Additionally he should be able to authenticate into the application - if he is not authenticated the dashboard should perform READ only operations.

Captain Nemo expects to see themes throughout the application that radiate the classic opulence and grandeur of Nautilus.
